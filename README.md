# kapitan-vscode-extension
VSCode Extension for Kapitan.

### Requirements
The extension requires that a python>=3.11 installation exists in your system, with the venv and pip modules present. Upon installation, the extension will ask you to select python's path if e.g. the default python installation is too old.

### Developing the extension
For instructions related to developing the extension see [this README](https://github.com/kapicorp/kapitan-vscode-extension/blob/main/README_DEV.md).
